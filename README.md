Hello and Welcome to the README for EmuNES, EmuNES is an emulator developed by The Linux Trans.

EmuNES was HEAVILY helped for by [javidx9](https://www.youtube.com/@javidx9), and [The NES Dev Wiki](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Nesdev_Wiki).

EmuNES can do quite a bit as an emulator, but it does not have the most accurate emulation, there do exist better NES emulators out there.
